# Plant-Widget

The Plant Widget program runs on Java 21 and JavaFX 17. You only need to download one project from Github to run it. You may or may not need to download JavaFX to be able to run the program. Make sure to load all the Maven Dependencies that pop up in Intellji, otherwise do it from the settings.

You run the program by navigating this file tree : src>main>java>com.example.plantwidget_gui18>HelloApplication.

HelloApplication is where the main is found. The program executes here and when executed there should pop up a GUI window and also two lines in the console, stating the version of JavaFX.
